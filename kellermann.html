        <p>
          <em>(As you can probably tell, this project page is currently under construction. Check back soon for complete details!)</em><br>
          I'm really excited to share this project. During college I took several courses in social entrepreneurship, nonprofits, and sustainability that really changed the way I saw economic and social progress around the world. So when it came to building experience for my UX career, I wanted to spend time volunteering for awesome nonprofits who otherwise couldn't afford design talent.
          <br><br>
          Thanks to <a href="http://www.catchafire.org" target="_blank">Catchafire.org</a>, I was introduced to Ms. Sally Stillings, the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.kellermannfoundation.org" target="_blank">Kellermann Foundation</a>. KF is doing phenomenal things in Uganda - their core focus being education, economic development, and health in the Batwa region. What I admire most is the foundation's approach to long-term sustainability, empowering the remote tribe of Ugandan Batwa pygmies instead of creating a level of dependency. 
          <br><br>
          Like many nonprofits, their website hasn't been updated in many, many years. And with rising competition from other web-savvy nonprofits, a better UX is key for nonprofits like KF for a number of reasons, as I'll explain below.
        </p>
      
      <h2 id=""><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Approaching the Project</h2>
        <p>
          <div class="pic-container">
              <a id="single_1" class="fancybox" href="images/kf-old-web-full.png"><div class="full-pic kf-old"></div></a>
              <div class="pic-container-footer">Old version of the website.<br>(Click to enlarge)</div>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p>
          To be quite honest, I didn't know how I would approach this project. Since it was my first probono gig, I wanted to be ambitious, build the entire site, and get experience in every step to the design/development process. However, I quickly realized I lacked the necessary skills (and time) to not rely on CMS platforms like WordPress. During our initial interview, I explained to Ms. Stillings that we'd most likely use WordPress and if her staff wasn't familiar with the system, I'd be happy to teach them the basics. We agreed that'd be our best shot at success.

          <br><br>

          I knew early on that this project will be more than just a re-design of their website, but rather an overhaul of their online revenue strategy. As you probably already know, nonprofits like KF rely on donations to maintain their projects abroad. However, most nonprofits haven't grasped the power of online fundraising just yet because they are often understaffed.

        <p>Because this project was entirely remote, it was an <strong>absolute necessity</strong> to communicate every single step of the way in order to avoid miscommunication.
        <br><br>
        After showing Sally my basic sketch, she gave the thumbs-up to create a quick wireframe for better visualization. She also requested an updated Site Map to better understand how information will be categorized in the new design. Here's what I drew up:
        </p>

        <div class="pic-container">
          <a id="single_1" class="fancybox" href="images/kf-sitemap.png"><div class="half-pic kf-sitemap"></div></a>
          <a id="single_1" class="fancybox" href="images/kf-wf-1.png"><div class="half-pic kf-wf-1"></div></a>

          <div class="pic-container-footer">Basic Site Map and Wireframe<br>(Click a picture to enlarge)</div>
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>
          Ms. Stillings thought favorably about the first draft of the wireframe, but she requested something more visual to show her team. Because we'd be using a custom WordPress theme, I explained to her that I won't change the skeleton of the wireframe to our perfection, but rather show how the content will be displayed. Here's what I made for her:
        </p>

        <div class="pic-container">
          <a id="single_1" class="fancybox" href="images/kf-mu-1.png"><div class="pic kf-mu-1"></div></a>
