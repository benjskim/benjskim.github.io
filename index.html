He was instrumental in creating a positive, collaborative and fun atmosphere for other students. Ben has a unique ability to balance personal ambition and determination with an effort to ensure that everyone in a group is thriving. His intelligence (both raw and emotional) truly stood out, and I have absolutely no doubt that Ben will accomplish some truly great things in the future.</br></br>

He was proactive with his communication, ensuring his team was on-target throughout the process and making adjustments as needed. Of the 6 teams we worked with, his was clearly one of the best both in the quality of the work and the final presentation.</br></br>
