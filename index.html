          Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a marketing/brand manager based in Los Angeles, California. This May, I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelors of Arts in Television and Media Studies. Though I'm primarily a marketer, I love coding during my free time. Otherwise, I spend my time reading, writing, looking for cool articles on Reddit, or playing basketball.

            <p>&#147;Ben participated in my company&apos;s first full-time Ruby on Rails Development program and I was consistently impressed by his commitment to learn something completely new, especially since the program was held in another country. He was instrumental in creating a positive, collaborative and fun atmosphere for other students. Ben has a unique ability to balance personal ambition and determination with an effort to ensure that everyone in a group is thriving. His intelligence (both raw and emotional) truly stood out, and I have absolutely no doubt that Ben will accomplish some truly great things in the future.&#148;</br></br>

            <p>&#147;Ben provided valuable insights, great creativity, broad systemic thinking, while also being a hard worker&#8230; due to his personality, inquisitive nature, and always wanting to learn and grow more.&#148;</br></br>

            <p>&#147;Ben led a team on a project where the boundaries and expectations were unclear and conditions were shifting. He was proactive with his communication, ensuring his team was on-target throughout the process and making adjustments as needed. Of the 6 teams we worked with, his was clearly one of the best both in the quality of the work and the final presentation.&#148;</br></br>

            <p>&#147;Ben has a positive attitude in working and communicating with the other staff. He was always willing to do more than just his job. If he didn&apos;t understand a goal or project, he asked appropriate questions to make sure he delivered what was needed.&#148;</br></br>
