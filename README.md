UX Portfolio of Ben Kim 


Notes:
- Make a better home page: maybe try "Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a UX Designer in Los Angeles, CA that can take a product from ideation to a prototype and from launch to data-driven iteration."
- Try to avoid the Jr. label
- Make the main section bigger and minimize the background transparency
- Separate sections for sketching, wireframing, prototype, etc.
